# Open Virtual Steering with BLESteeringServer
The **Romans** knew it already **`"Sterzare Necesse Est"`** (free after Plutarch) and it is still valid in a **virtual cycling world**.<br>
<details><summary>What is means</summary>
    
The original quote **Navigare Necesse Est** ("Navigation is Necessary"), was humourously adapted here, by replacing **Navigare** with the Italian verb for [**steering**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sterzare), aligning it with the project's theme.

</details>

**Open Virtual Steering** is an open-source project that explores interfacing with various **Human-Interface-Devices (HID)** for the **use case of steering control** in **virtual cycling platforms**.
It provides examples of alternative input methods for **navigating and positioning a cycling avatar** in a virtual world. 

## 📦 What Is This?

**BLESteeringServer** is an open-source, Arduino-compatible C++ library that provides a **reusable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server** implementation for transmitting **steering data** to virtual cycling platforms.

It is designed as a **shared backend** for projects in the **Open Virtual Steering** ecosystem and supports pairing with BLE clients that recognize a known **steering profile** used in commercial platforms.

## 🔧 How the code works

With the **BLESteeringServer** library installed, developers can easily create applications that act as **dedicated BLE steering controllers** for use with **virtual cycling platforms**.

The user application is responsible for interfacing with a **Human Interface Device (HID)** — such as buttons, a joystick, an IMU, or voice input — and regularly passing steering data to the BLESteeringServer.

Once paired with a BLE client, the application uses `BLESteeringServer::updateSteeringValue()` to transmit real-time **steering angle data** over Bluetooth.

To ensure **interoperability**, the library implements a known **BLE Steering Profile**, which defines a consistent structure of services and characteristics used in commercial BLE steering devices. BLE profiles serve as an **application-layer contract** between the controller (peripheral) and the receiving client (central), ensuring compatibility across devices and platforms.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
The functionality of **Open Virtual Steering with BLESteeringServer** was tested using **standard BLE debugging tools** to ensure proper communication and responsiveness. One of the primary tools used was **nRF Connect for Mobile**, a widely available application for **scanning, connecting, and interacting with BLE devices**. This allowed for **verification of characteristic read/write operations, response timing, and general stability** of the BLE communication.  

## 🔧 Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <BLESteeringServer.h>

void setup() {
    BLESteeringServer::getInstance().begin();
}

void loop() {
    float angle = getSteeringAngleFromHID();
    BLESteeringServer::getInstance().updateSteeringValue(angle);
}
```
