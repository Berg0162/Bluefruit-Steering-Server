# <img src="/media/Nordic_Icon.png" width="53" height="50" align="bottom" alt="Nordic Icon"> Open Virtual Steering with BluefruitSteeringServer
The **Romans** knew it already **`"Sterzare Necesse Est"`** (free after Plutarch) and it is still valid in a **virtual cycling world**.<br>
<details><summary>What is means</summary>
    
The original quote **Navigare Necesse Est** ("Navigation is Necessary"), was humourously adapted here, by replacing **Navigare** with the Italian verb for [**steering**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sterzare), aligning it with the project's theme.

</details>

**Open Virtual Steering (OVS)** is an open-source project that explores interfacing with various **Human-Interface-Devices (HID)** for the **use case of steering control** in **virtual cycling platforms**.
It provides examples of alternative input methods for **navigating and positioning a cycling avatar** in a virtual world. 

## üì¶ What Is This?

**BluefruitSteeringServer** is an Arduino-compatible C++ library that provides a ready-to-use **BLE server implementation** for **steering control in virtual cycling platforms**, built specifically for the **Adafruit Bluefruit (Nordic's nRF52) ecosystem**.

It is the **nRF52/Bluefruit sibling** of the [BLESteeringServer](https://github.com/Berg0162/BLE-Steering-Server) library, and is designed to serve as the BLE communication layer for applications using **alternative Human Interface Devices (HIDs)** ‚Äî such as buttons, joysticks, motion sensors, or voice input.

The library handles BLE advertisement, pairing, and the transmission of **steering angle data** using a known **steering profile**, enabling smooth integration with virtual cycling clients that support BLE steering controllers.

It is used as a backend in projects focused on HID-based steering control.

This project allows users to explore a range of input devices for **steering control in virtual cycling worlds**. The emphasis is on **enhancing interactivity and user experience** through both **accessible** and **innovative** control methods.

## ‚ùì What is Bluefruit?

**Bluefruit** is Adafruit's branding for its line of development boards and firmware built around **Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 family** of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips.

This repository provides code that specifically targets **Adafruit's Bluefruit stack**, using their `Bluefruit.begin()`, `BLEService`, and `BLECharacteristic` APIs ‚Äî separate from ESP32 or NimBLE-based implementations.

## üîß How the code works

With the **BluefruitSteeringServer** library installed, developers can easily create applications that act as **dedicated BLE steering controllers** for use with **virtual cycling platforms**.

The user application is responsible for interfacing with a **Human Interface Device (HID)** ‚Äî such as buttons, a joystick, an IMU, or voice input ‚Äî and regularly passing steering data to the BluefruitSteeringServer.

Once paired with a BLE client, the application uses `BluefruitSteeringServer::updateSteeringValue()` to transmit real-time **steering angle data** over Bluetooth.

To ensure **interoperability**, the library implements a known **BLE Steering Profile**, which defines a consistent structure of services and characteristics used in commercial BLE steering devices. BLE profiles serve as an **application-layer contract** between the controller (peripheral) and the receiving client (central), ensuring compatibility across devices and platforms.

## üß™ Testing & Validation
The functionality of **Open Virtual Steering with BluefruitSteeringServer** was tested using **standard BLE debugging tools** to ensure proper communication and responsiveness. One of the primary tools used was **nRF Connect for Mobile**, a widely available application for **scanning, connecting, and interacting with BLE devices**. This allowed for **verification of characteristic read/write operations, response timing, and general stability** of the BLE communication.  

## üîß Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <BluefruitSteeringServer.h>

void setup() {
    BluefruitSteeringServer::getInstance().begin();
}

void loop() {
    float angle = getSteeringAngleFromHID();
    BluefruitSteeringServer::getInstance().updateSteeringValue(angle);
}
